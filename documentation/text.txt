Ever wondered how your Xbox 360 profile looks from the inside? Here, let me show you!

Your profile is stored in a single file in a format called STFS package. *Secure Transacted File System
This basically is a mini file system within a file.

Like many other file types in computer history an STFS package starts with a little magic as well.
*Explain Magic

Right after that comes a signature which certificates your profile.
