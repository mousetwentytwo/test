Does anyone still read readme files? :)

You can get the latest release versions of SpreadsheetLight at
http://spreadsheetlight.com/

You can send feedback, bug findings and goodwill at the website above.
Or use this email address if you like:
support@spreadsheetlight.com

I actually read emails. :)

SpreadsheetLight uses the MIT License. There's a license.txt somewhere in your download.
Basically you can do whatever you want with the source code and the library,
provided that the author(s) [that's me] isn't/aren't liable for damages.
Read the license for the full thing because this summary doesn't do it justice.

Thanks for using SpreadsheetLight!

With gratitude,
